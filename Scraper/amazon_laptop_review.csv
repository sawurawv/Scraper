			    	",D.Z,"Best computer I've ever owned. No other laptop is anywhere near this laptop. The touchpad is even as good as the MacBook 12"" I used to have. This runs Age of Empires Discovery Edition just as well as the two other 'gaming' laptops Ive tried, both with discreet graphic cards and weighing a TON more with HUGE power bricks. Don't forget the power brick size is important too. Since this can be charged off usb-c, it opens up all of those possibilities as well. A neat trick I did was to use 'cloudready' (chrome os on a usb drive), disabled secure boot and adjusted the boot order so usb drive was first, and now I can just use a usb drive to boot up into chrome os (i.e. it turns it into a chromebook). (Although the trackpad isn't as good as it is in windows, but an external mouse works fine). Because LG designed it to run on the basic drivers without a bunch of CRAPWARE like with many laptops, it runs Chrome OS great! To boot into windows I just shut down and remove the usb stick. It boots SUPER fast, I can't emphasize enough the raw performance this thing has. Everything about it is perfect, I've never encountered a perfect laptop before.  When gaming the battery only lasts about 5-6 hours. When web browsing it will last much much longer, and you can easily set the performance mode by clicking on the battery icon in the system tray at the bottom level and simply sliding the slider to the left for better battery. I don't even notice a performance downgrade when putting it all the way to best battery settings.

			    	",l2,"Chromebook prices range from around $100 to over $1000. Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos.

I didn't want to pay again more than $1000 for a laptop. All she needs is MSOffice and Chrome, it doesn't matter if it is MacOS or Windows. I wanted a laptop with comparable quality and good looks at a lower price. So in the end, ASUS Zenbook 14 looked like an option. The hardware is actually better than Macbook Air since Zenbook 14 has U series quad-core processor instead of dual-core Y-series processors used in latest gen Macbook Air. I have been using a Y-series dual-core Dell Latitude E7370 Ultrabook and I can tell that the quad-core U-series CPU is noticeably faster. However U-series CPUs require better cooling. My Dell E7370 does not even have a cooling fan and about 1/2 lbs lighter. I think the interesting LCD hinge design of Zenbook 14 actually helps with cooling (more than ergonomics as advertised) by elevating the air intake grill at the bottom for better air flow. When the processor is has work load, I can hear the fans of Zenbook 14. Screen is a very high quality LCD panel, it has accurate colors, good contrast, and brightness. The body looks very much like metal (although I think it is plastic) and there is no excessive flex; construction quality is strong and materials feel high quality. The installed Windows 10 came with McAfee security software which I have uninstalled at once together with some other minor unnecessary software like ASUS application store, LinkedIn, and a couple of games. I have reverted back to default Microsoft security software and I did not feel the need to reinstall Windows.  I have updated the Intel graphics, WiFi, and Bluetooth software to the latest versions directly from Intel as well (installing graphics driver required uninstallation of the original). WiFi performance (Intel AC 9560) is pretty good with our TPLink A7 router. The SSD is an OEM Western Digital unit and performs great. Keyboard is backlit with three lighting levels plus it can be turned off. Actually, keyboard backlight was initially off and I had to figure out that the F7 key was controlling it. Oh and the sound! Zenbook 14 has a very good sound system. If there is nobody to disturb around, one can simply enjoy the music/video without the headphones.  The battery life looks decent; it can easily last two full movies on battery or typing a document all day. The keyboard has good feeling with decent travel distance while typing.

			    	",ttview,"The fan noise on this laptop is so bad that when you first hear it you're going to think your next door neighboor is using a leaf blower outside. I DARE you to tell me i'm wrong. I have an Acer aspire E15 and an acer aspire 5 (5504) and the fan noise combined from those two laptops are less than 1/8th the loudness of this new laptop. IT IS TERRIBLE. Think you can live with that? There's more: If you're a long time user of acer products you've become used to the 2nd function keys being assigned between the F3 to F9 keys and in blue. Thats GONE with this laptop. Here's the new configuration. F1 (previously f4) is the sleep function key, F2 (previously unassigned) is now airplane mode/wifi disable key, F3 and F4 (previously wifi and sleep respectively) are to adjust screen brightness, F8 (previously mute function key) has switched places with F9 now serving the keyboard backlight on/off function, F9 (previously keyboard backlighting function) is actually the mute function key. F10 and F11 (previously unassigned) are now the volume down and up function keys respectively. Just to add some additional frustration to the mix none of these keys are the second function anymore. So if you're used to hitting F5 to refresh browser windows or F3 to search now you'll need to hit the Fn Key first as the media functions take precedence in this new keyboard layout. This can actually be changed by rebooting and pressing F2 to enter the bios settings before windows loads. Even if you change the F1 - F12 keys back to their original hierarchic order the arrow keys are no longer the keys to access brightness or volume control but instead are music media keys. Good luck with that confusion. This new laptop basically is an all out attack on keyboard shortcut users even the Home key is now a point of frustration since they removed the dedicated home key and you're only left with the numlock access only home key that shares functionality with the number 7 key on the keypad. I also had to finish install necessary driver level software like the ""acer quick access application"" because as this was not installed there was no way to know if num lock or capslock was engaged as there is no LED indicating the status of these keys. Even if you Update the bios to the latest firmware version like I did it still won't solve the problem of the USB 3.0 ports having slower read/write speeds than a typical USB 2.0 port.",1.0,"June 28, 2019"

			    	",Birds,"Battery life: On light loads like browsing news sites on Edge or grabbing games on Steam, you might see around two hours on a full charge, and if that's a deal-breaker for you, you'll want to re-evaluate your criteria for a laptop. The CPU and GPU in this laptop have been fantastic for my use case (Fusion 360, ZBrush, Blender, and all the games I care to throw at it), but the 48Wh battery in this means you'll likely only want this if you only plan to have this plugged in most of the time, because that two hours I mentioned earlier is going to look a lot more like one hour or less when you start driving the CPU/GPU hard. Worth mentioning, btw, the battery is fairly easy to swap if you ever find the need after the warranty runs out. No way of knowing what kind of availability we'll see for replacements after this is EoL'd, but if they're available whenever that day comes, it's just a matter of unplugging the battery, removing a couple retaining screws, and gently lifting it out. Unlike some devices, the battery in this laptop isn't held down with a giant mess of glue, so this has the potential to have a very long service life without being a pain to DIY repair.",5.0,"June 8, 2019"

			    	",Jerser008Roxxor,"The specs on this chromebook are amazing, so I bought one.  I had trouble viewing the keyboard, especially with the backlighting on as other reviewers have noted. The characters on the keys are cutouts, like a face carved in a Halloween pumpkin, so there is no contrast in a non-dark room when the backlight is on. You can't read the keyboard! If you turn the backlight off, every little ray of ambient light that reflects on the keyboard also kills the contrast and makes it unreadable. It's awful. Had I used the C425 for a minute in a store, that would have been a deal-buster. However, I tried to work past that by taking it with me to my usual locations where i work. The long and short of it is that the C425 does a poor job of pulling in WIFI connections. With my old HP chromebook, I had no such troubles at the exact same locations where the C425 can't find a connection. I *REALLY* wanted to love the C425 but that was a  deal-buster. I packed it up and sent it back.

I decided to go with Asus because my Vivobook from 2013 was keeping up with my workload pretty well and it was extremely reliable. Yes there's some coil whine and no the battery doesn't last that long but I don't care. I just need it to look nice and be efficient and it is. I can edit 4K raw footage with no problems and render times are absolutely incredible.  When working with music production I can open a project with 50+ plugins and have many other programs running and it works flawlessly. This laptop handles thermals well and I don't experience very much throttling at all when working. It is all metal and it is really thin for what it's packing inside. Yes, it has keyboard flex if you try but you have other problems if you are pressing the keys that hard.

System will completely blank out the screen with no system response unless you hold the power button down.  When turning the system back on and log back into Windows, the screen would flicker a lot for maybe 10 seconds then look perfectly fine afterwards.  This issue continued at random with the same blank screen issue.  Battery had about 50% capacity at the end.  House has an ambient temp of 77 degree F with a ceiling fan for the controlled environment.

			    	",Dylan Johnson," People whine about thermal throttling and coil whine, no pun intended! ;) But seriously, I bought this used like-new condition from Amazon warehouse which was most likely a return and CDI showed only a couple hours on the SSD. I love this laptop and have had it for about a month now. I hardly ever write product reviews, but it seems like there are a lot of complaints about this laptop and it doesn't get the credit it deserves. For these specs while maintaining slim and light profile good luck finding a better deal. I did pay $1400 plus tax which is slightly lower than the current price but I challenge others to comment on laptops with similar specs and design quality to compare this to. The Dell XPS 15 is in the archetype but lacks the specs unless you want to pay $2000. And sure, it has a 4k display, but at the cost of earlier GPU model, on a 15"" with the pixel density, 4k is just marketing unless you need 4k for visual design projects there is not much point, you have to render 4k and then increase zoom anyway. There are some drawbacks though and 1. I am not super impressed with the keyboard. It performs fine and no problems with ghosting, but when I'm really hammering away at the keys like I'm used to doing on my desktop pc, there is a slight rattle, but that's just me being too rough on the keyboard due to my fast and high-actuation force typing habits. The next issue is that I really liked the silver design of the UX430UN, and I wish they would have incorporated that design into this build rather than the black spun metal which is very attractive and has class, but also attracts fingerprints. So have an anti-static microfiber cloth and screen/keyboard cleaner handy (which you should when you own a touchscreen laptop anyway), but it's not as bad as I might make it sound. It's not a fingerprint magnet, it's just that the silver spun metal design didn't show any fingerprints, greasy or clean barely. Lastly, sure, there is some thermal throttling if you are playing graphic intensive games, but I can play Destiny 2 on Medium settings with a few things tweaked at 60FPS no problem. It will start to slow down as it heats up a little bit, but a Havik cooling pad eliminates that problem. Keep in mind this is not a gaming-designed laptop although it plays most games very well. The thermal engineering was done well and the keyboard never gets hot, only the back and only when you're running the GPU at full load for an extended period. Any other case it runs cool, setting it on your lap and browsing, editing office files, watching videos, it will stay nice and cool for around 10-11 hours of basic mixed use.",5.0,"May 3, 2018"
